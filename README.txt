DE2_NIOS_HOST_MOUSE_VGA
-----------------------

This designs uses a Nios II system to demonstrate how to communicate with a USB device connected to the USB HOST port on the DE2 board. This design implements a monochrome display, with a preloaded image, where the user can draw on it with a mouse. A USB mouse should be connected to the USB HOST port and a CRT/LCD monitor should be connected to the VGA port.

Running the Design
------------------

1) Launch the Quartus II software.
2) Open the DE2_NIOS_HOST_MOUSE_VGA.qpf project located in the <install path>\DE2_NIOS_HOST_MOUSE_VGA folder. (File menu -> Open Project)
3) Open the Programmer window. (Tools menu -> Programmer)
4) The DE2_NIOS_HOST_MOUSE_VGA.sof programming file should be listed.
   Check the 'Program/Configure' box and set up the JTAG programming hardware connection via the 'Hardware Setup' button.
